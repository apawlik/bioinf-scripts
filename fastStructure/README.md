This directory (`fastStructure`) contains materials for a workshop teaching using fastStructure software for analysing population genetics data. 

The data and scripts used come from several sources:
* prepared by Manpreet Dhami (Manaaki Whenua Landcare Research) with help from Ben Roberts (NeSI NZ)
* developed for the course [Population Genetics with R](https://grunwaldlab.github.io/Population_Genetics_in_R/gbs_analysis.html)
