This directory contains examples of shell scripts which may be useful for researchers in bioinformatics. The scripts operate on sample data consisting of various `fasta`and `fa`files, as well as text files and `csv`files.

### Objectives

1. Script `organise_files.sh` shows examples of how to:
* set up directories for your project;
* download data files and place them in correct directories;
* do some data pre-cleaning using `sed`, `grep` and other command line tools.

2. Script `shell_gotchas.sh` shows some particularities of writing scripts which may catch you, if you are new to sxcripting:
* escaping special characters
* the difference between using ' and " (single and double quotes)
* using script variables and shell variables
* reading in arguments for the script from the command line (user input)
